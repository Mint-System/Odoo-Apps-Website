# AGENTS.md

This file has been created from `$HOME/taskfile.build/AGENTS.md.template`.

Note: @Clanker refers to the "ai agent" (you) who is working on this task.

## General agent guidance

This section outlines the universal rules and expectations for any LLM agent working
within this repository.

**Safety and Quality First:** The highest priority is to produce secure,
well-documented, and high-quality code. Do not introduce vulnerabilities, hardcoded
secrets, or unreadable code.

**Propose a Plan:** For any new task, first provide a brief plan of action. This plan
should clearly outline the intended changes and the rationale behind them.

**Maintain Context:** Before making any changes, an agent must read and understand the
relevant files, including the project's main documentation and existing code structure.

**Be Sparse:** Only introduce new code if needed. Comment only what is worth commenting.
When testing focus on the business use case.

## Environment & tooling

### Taskfile

This project uses the <https://taskfile.build/> standard.

The `./task` file is a bash script that provides all functions necessary to work with
this project.

Always try to run a command with the `./task` file script.

### New Tools

Do not automatically install new software packages. Always ask for permission.

### Temporary files

When creating temporary fiels and scripts, use the `./tmp` directory.

## Project structure

@Clanker this is specific to every project. Update according to your discoveries.

## Coding conventions

### Bash

The following guideline is heavily based on the
[Bash Style Guide | ysap.sh](https://style.ysap.sh/), which should be considered the
primary reference for style. Adhere to the following principles to ensure scripts are
safe, predictable, and maintainable.

**Shebang:** Start scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for portability.

**Quoting:** This is critical.

- Use double quotes `"` for strings that require variable expansion.
- Use single quotes `'` for all other strings.

**Always quote variable expansions** `"$var"` to prevent word-splitting and globbing
issues.

**Variables:** Distinct between local and environment vars.

- Use `local` for all variables inside functions.
- Use lowercase names for local variables (e.g., `buildx_output`).
- Use uppercase names for environment variables (e.g. `export BUILDX_PLATFORM`)

**Functions:**

- Do not use the `function` keyword.
- Use `my-func() { ... }` syntax.
- Function names are in kebab case.

**Conditionals:**

- Always use `[[ ... ]]` for conditional testing, not `[ ... ]` or `test`.
- Use `((...))` for arithmetic comparisons (e.g., `((a > b))`).
- When replacing `[]` with `[[]]` make sure to escape the brackets. The `[]` is a regex
  filter.

**Command Substitution:**

- Always use `$(...)` for command substitution, not backticks.

**Arrays:**

- Use Bash arrays to manage lists of items instead of space-separated strings.
- Iterate over arrays using `for item in "${my_array[@]}"; do ... done`.

**Avoid External Commands:**

- Use Bash's built-in parameter expansion for string manipulation (e.g.,
  `${var/foo/bar}`).
- Use globbing (`*`) to iterate over files, not `ls`.
- Avoid `cat` when a command can read a file directly (e.g., `grep "pattern" file`).

**eval:** Never use `eval`.

**Logging:**

- Use single quotes for outputs without variables.
- Use double quotes for outputs with variables.
- Do not finish sentence with a dot if action is following (e.g. `"Backup file"`).
- Finish sentence with a dot if echo is after action (e.g. `"Backup finished."`).
